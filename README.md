## Inspiration
This COVID-19 Pandemic has made us stick to our home. Companies started work from home but for voting, ahh! we are still following the same old methods for finding the right person. Our team always believes that the person leading all should be selected by all and through these words, we aim towards achieving 100% of the voting by citizens. With countries around the world becoming more divided, we ultimately trust one another less and lessâ€”especially when coming to counting ballots. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are more fearful of leaving their homes. With the upcoming Indian state election, many Indians are forced to risk their health and safety just to exercise their basic voting rights This is why we created MATDAAN a web application that allows users around the country to vote from their respective homes.

## What it Does
MATDAAN is a decentralized voting system that uses blockchain technology to store ballots users have to register themself on the web portal using their verifiable IDs issued by the respective government. Once we verify them using Azure credentials, they will enter the Electronic polling booth through which they can cast their vote respectively. After someone has casted their vote we will issue a certificate consisting of the representative they have opted for

## How We Built It
We built it using React, Solidity, CSS, Figma, Truffle

## Challenges we ran into

One of our most difficult challenges was coming up with a secure verification system. Moving forward, we hope to spend more time working with the verification API and smart contracts

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Prior to starting this project our team had no experience with developing a blockchain network. However, fuelled by a passion to learn about this new technology, our team was able to leverage prior technical experiences to create a fully functional blockchain system. This process of learning a new technology required extensive time and effort. Our ability to learn all this information in such a short period of time was extremely difficult, however, through persistence and perseverance we were able to successfully complete our initial goal.

## What we learned

The process of coming up with the idea to developing the entire infrastructure and final product has allowed us to discover the potential of decentralized system on improving many aspects of our daily life especially when combined by Artificial Intelligence Solutions. We learned that one can leverage the blockchain to create a system which is free of any external party intervention while maintain a sophisticated and seamless process for the end user. This idea has inspired us to think about other potential applications of a decentralized systems, and more specifically a blockchain structure.

## What's next for MATDAAN

MATDAAN blockchain system currently has the ability to scale to an extremely large scale. However, for MATDAAN to be used on a mass scale, it must be further optimized from a verification perspective. Through further development on improving the integration between the SMS messaging and the verification system, we can make MATDAAN a more seamless system.
MATDAAN main purpose was to be used in an election system. However, MATDAAN has the potential to be used in many different areas. In recent years we have seen more attention towards ensuring everyones voice is heard and that we engage in processes which promote equality. With MATDAAN, we are able to offer a platform for groups people to share their thoughts and ideas in an impactful way, while ensuring their voice is heard.
