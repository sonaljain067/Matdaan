## Inspiration
This Covid-19 has made us stick to our home companies preferred work from home but for voting ahh we are still following the same old methods for finding the right person. Our team always believes that the person leading all should be selected by all and through these words, we aim towards achieving 100 percent of the voting. With countries around the world becoming more divided, we ultimately trust one another less and lessâ€”especially when coming to counting ballots. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are more fearful of leaving their homes. With the upcoming Indian state election, many Indians are forced to risk their health and safety just to exercise their basic voting rights This is why we created MATDAN a web application that allows users around the country to vote from their respective homes.

## What it Does
MATDAN is a decentralized voting system that uses blockchain technology to store ballots users have to register themself on the web portal using their verifiable IDs issued by the respective government.Once we verify them using Azure credentials they will enter the Electronic polling booth through which they can cast their vote respectively. After someone has cast their vote we will issue a certificate consisting of the representative they have opted for
